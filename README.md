GUI Design â€“ Description (Using PyQt6)
Graphical User Interface (GUI) design using PyQt6 involves building visually interactive applications with the help of Python and the Qt6 framework. PyQt6 is a powerful set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework, allowing developers to create cross-platform, professional-quality GUI applications.

In this project, GUI components such as windows, buttons, labels, input fields, and custom widgets were designed and implemented using PyQt6. The focus was on providing a user-friendly, intuitive, and responsive interface that allows users to interact with the system efficiently.

Key aspects of the GUI design using PyQt6 include:

  1.Layout Management: Used layouts like QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, and QGridLayout to organize widgets systematically.

  2.Event Handling: Connected signals (such as button clicks) to slots (Python functions) to define application behavior.

  3.Custom Drawing (Optional): Employed QPainter and QPen for drawing circuit diagrams or graphical elements when needed.

  4.Styling: Applied styles using Qt Style Sheets (QSS) to enhance the look and feel of the application.

  5.Cross-Platform Support: Ensured the GUI works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

PyQt6 offers a modular approach to GUI development, allowing for scalable, maintainable, and reusable code. This makes it suitable for both simple applications and complex interactive systems.
